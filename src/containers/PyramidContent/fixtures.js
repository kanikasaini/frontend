Senior citizens have a right to claim maintenance from their children or relatives if they are unable to take care of themselves.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Parents can claim maintenance from children or grandchildren.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Senior citizens without children can claim maintenance from relatives who will inherit their property.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>You can make an application before special courts known as maintenance tribunals. The amount of maintenance you can ask <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-9">cannot generally exceed Rupees 10,000 per month</a>. You cannot simultaneously make an <a href="http://nyaaya.in/guide-to-marriage-divorce-and-maintenance/maintenance-laws/parents/under-the-crpc/">application for maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>The law also allows you to get out of agreements where you have transferred property expecting your needs to being taken care of. If the person to whom the property is transferred then does not take care of your basic needs, you can restore the property in your name.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Abandoning your parents or relatives who are senior citizens is a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="do-i-have-a-right-to-maintenance-under-this-law-from-whom-can-i-claim-maintenance-">Do I have a right to maintenance under this law? From whom can I claim maintenance?</h3>\r\n<p>If you are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a senior citizen (above the age of 60); and</li>\r\n<li>are not able to take care of yourself properly from your earnings or your property.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-3">can file a maintenance application </a>against:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>your children (who are above the age of 18); or</li>\r\n<li>your grandchildren (who are above the age of 18); or</li>\r\n<li>if you do not have children, your relatives (who are above the age of 18 and who are using your property or will inherit your property).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are a senior citizen without children, the relatives against whom you can file a petition will generally depend on the religious law applicable to you. It could be your siblings, your parents or nieces and nephews.</p>\r\n<h3 id="i-have-executed-an-agreement-with-a-friend-for-provision-of-maintenance-can-i-approach-the-maintenance-tribunal-if-this-is-not-being-honoured-">I have executed an agreement with a friend for provision of maintenance. Can I approach the maintenance tribunal if this is not being honoured?</h3>\r\n<p>It is possible that you made alternate arrangements for taking care of yourself in your old age. Given that you are not able to take care of your family estate, you might have transferred the property to a friend or sold it with a provision for you to receive maintenance.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>If you have executed an agreement to transfer your property to someone (say through a gift deed) with the condition that your basic needs will be taken care of, and your friend does not honour this, you can apply to the maintenance tribunal for help. The court can pass an order declaring that the agreement is invalid and<a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-23"> you will be the legal owner of the property</a> again.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>In <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-23">another situation</a>, say you have the right to receive maintenance out of the proceeds of a property. If this property is later sold to someone else who knew you had such right or if this property is gifted or willed away, you have a right to claim maintenance against the person who now owns the property.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="i-am-an-adoptive-parent-can-i-still-file-a-maintenance-application-if-i-am-not-able-to-take-care-of-myself-">I am an adoptive parent. Can I still file a maintenance application if I am not able to take care of myself?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, you can. The law <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-2">does not distinguish</a> between birth parents and adoptive or step parents. The duty on children to support parents includes adoptive parents and step parents. So you can file an application against your adopted child or step child for maintenance.</p>\r\n<h3 id="where-do-i-go-to-make-a-maintenance-application-">Where do I go to make a maintenance application?</h3>\r\n<p>You can file an application in a maintenance tribunal under this law.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-7"><u>Maintenance Tribunal</u></a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The maintenance tribunal is a special court set up under this law. According to <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=108580">government information from 2014</a>, 24 states and 6 union territories have set up appellate tribunals.</li>\r\n<li>Maintenance tribunals have to be set up by state governments in each sub-division.</li>\r\n<li>This court has the powers of a normal civil court and can issue summons.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-6"><u>Area in which you can file the application</u>:</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can file an application in the maintenance tribunal in the area where you live currently or have lived in the past or where your children or relatives live.</li>\r\n<li>You cannot file an application for maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (which also gives you the right) and under this law. Please remember that there is no cap on the amount of monthly maintenance you can seek under the Code. However, it could be a lengthier process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><u>Process:</u></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>After you have filed an application (formats will vary from state to state), the court will first <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-6">notify your children</a> and tell them that you have filed such an application.</li>\r\n<li>In the next stage, the court can decide to <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-6">refer the case to a Conciliation Officer</a> who will then try to get the parties to agree to a friendly settlement.</li>\r\n<li>If the court does not refer the case, it will listen to both parties (the parents and the children or relatives).</li>\r\n<li>The court will <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5">conduct an inquiry</a> to figure out how much maintenance you need to be paid. An inquiry is not a full blown legal proceeding. Even though the law does not allow for representation by lawyers in these courts, there are <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/156882703/">high court judgments </a>which have held that this right of lawyers cannot be restricted.</li>\r\n<li>Even though this court is slightly informal in nature, it has the <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-8">powers of a civil court</a> and can order attendance of witnesses, take evidence on oath etc.</li>\r\n<li>If the court finds that the children or relatives are neglecting to take care of the parents, they can <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-9">pass an order</a> directing them to pay a monthly maintenance. The court can also <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-13">order that interest</a> (between 5% and 8%) be paid on the maintenance amount from the date of the application.</li>\r\n<li>If your children or parents are not paying the maintenance even after the court order, <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-11">you can go to any similar court </a>(maintenance tribunal) and ask for help in enforcing the order.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="what-is-the-amount-of-maintenance-i-can-ask-for-">What is the amount of maintenance I can ask for?</h3>\r\n<p>As a senior citizen without children, you can ask for enough maintenance to live a normal life. However, there is a<a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-9"> general limit of Rupees 10,000 per month</a>. State governments can impose a lesser limit. Please check the rules passed by the state government under this law.</p>\r\n<h3 id="can-my-child-choose-to-provide-maintenance-for-me-and-not-my-wife-">Can my child choose to provide maintenance for me and not my wife?</h3>\r\n<p>No, your child has an <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-4">obligation to maintain both parents</a>. Both you and your wife have a right to live a normal life if you are not able to maintain yourself.</p>\r\n<h3 id="i-am-old-and-unable-to-visit-the-court-can-i-authorize-someone-else-to-make-an-application-on-my-behalf-">I am old and unable to visit the court. Can I authorize someone else to make an application on my behalf?</h3>\r\n<p>As a senior citizen or parent, you can make an application for maintenance yourself. However, if you are incapable of making an application, you can <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5">authorize someone else</a> or an organization to make the application on your behalf.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, the special court set up for this law can take up cases on its own.</p>\r\n<h3 id="can-i-get-any-maintenance-while-the-case-is-going-on-">Can I get any maintenance while the case is going on?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, you can make an application to the court to order your children or relatives to pay you <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5">temporary maintenance</a> (on a monthly basis).</p>\r\n<p>The court has to decide on whether you can get temporary maintenance within 90 days of informing your children or relatives of your application. In special circumstances, they can delay this for some more time (i.e. 30 days).</p>\r\n<p>This is not the final maintenance you can expect to get. The court may decide not to give you maintenance at all, or may decide to increase or decrease the amount of maintenance in the final order.</p>\r\n<h3 id="can-i-file-a-maintenance-application-against-more-than-one-child-or-relative-">Can I file a maintenance application against more than one child or relative?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes you can. As a parent, you can file your maintenance application <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5">against all your children</a>. All of them have a duty to maintain you.</p>\r\n<p>As a senior citizen (without children), you can file your maintenance application against any or all relatives who possess or will inherit your property. If there is more than one such relative, each relative is supposed to pay maintenance in proportion to the property that they will inherit from you.</p>\r\n<h3 id="if-my-parents-have-filed-a-maintenance-application-against-me-can-i-also-involve-my-brother-">If my parents have filed a maintenance application against me, can I also involve my brother?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, if you have siblings or other relatives who are legally supposed to maintain your parents/ senior citizen, <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5">you can file an application to get them involved in the case</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 id="one-of-my-children-passed-away-after-she-had-been-ordered-to-pay-maintenance-are-the-other-children-allowed-to-stop-paying-me-maintenance-">One of my children passed away after she had been ordered to pay maintenance. Are the other children allowed to stop paying me maintenance?</h3>\r\n<p>No, once a court has passed a maintenance order against your children or relatives, they have to follow it. The death of any one of your children or relatives <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5">cannot be used as an excuse</a> – the other children or relatives will have to continue paying you maintenance.</p>\r\n<h3 id="what-happens-if-my-children-do-not-follow-the-maintenance-orders-of-the-court-">What happens if my children do not follow the maintenance orders of the court?</h3>\r\n<p>You can make an application to any maintenance tribunal within 3 months of them not paying. The court can impose a fine on the children for the maintenance amount and expenses of the proceedings. The children can also be punished with<a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-5"> jail time of up to one month</a>. If they pay up before the end of the jail time, they will be released.</p>\r\n<h3 id="if-i-am-unhappy-with-the-maintenance-order-what-can-i-do-">If I am unhappy with the maintenance order, what can I do?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You have the <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-16">right to appeal</a> if you are a senior citizen who is unhappy with the order. According to the law, as a child or relative against whom an order has been passed, you do not have the right to appeal. However, certain high courts have held that the right to appeal is available to both parties.</li>\r\n<li>You can appeal to the higher or more superior court known as the ‘Appellate Tribunal’. Meanwhile, the children have to comply with the maintenance order.</li>\r\n<li>You should file this appeal <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-16">within 60 days of the order</a> from the maintenance tribunal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id="what-is-the-punishment-for-abandoning-senior-citizens-">What is the punishment for abandoning senior citizens?</h3>\r\n<p>If you leave a senior citizen at some place with the intention of abandoning them and not taking care of them, you can be <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-23">punished </a>with jail time of up to three months and/or a fine of up to Rupees five thousand. The police can make an arrest without the permission of a court. However, this is a bailable crime. If you are able to pay the bail bond, you will be released.</p>\r\n<h3 id="is-there-anything-else-i-should-know-">Is there anything else I should know?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>If you are a senior citizen and have filed a maintenance application under this law, you can ask for the help of the government appointed <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-18">‘Maintenance Officer</a>’.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>The State Governments have a duty to set up <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-19">old age homes</a> in each district for senior citizens who are unable to support themselves. This is to be implemented in a phased manner.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>The State Governments have a duty to provide <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/533/the-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-2007/#section-20">medical support to senior citizens</a> in government aided hospitals, providing treatment for chronic and terminal diseases and arrange separate queues for them.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>',
